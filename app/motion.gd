extends RefCounted
## Player body motion, ported from gone_app player/motion.rs: the mirror
## that follows the sim's phase machine through the authored get-up and
## the steadying walk. The sim owns every motion decision (the phase
## machine, the authored exit path, the walk ramp, the swept capsule);
## this class only wires the shared input plane, the machine, the
## collider set, and the exit path together, records the first typed
## rejection fail-fast, and never invents motion. Pure logic: testable
## headless with a plain Game container.

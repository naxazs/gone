## Root-script-owned container over the sim state instances, mirroring
## the Rust StasisScenePlugin contract: the frozen pod registry, the wake
## phase machine, the power grid, the wake timeline state, the authored
## player exit path, and the static collider set are inserted at their
## spawn state and ticked at the fixed 60 Hz physics rate. The sim is
## authoritative: this container reads it and never writes phases ahead
## of the controllers that own them (the wake driver is a later chunk).

## The doorway into the hallway opens on act with the rod carried and
## the hallway's fixtures light on the switch beside the doorway; both
## are authored with the hallway (issue #59's prerequisite milestone)
## and owned here, on the container. Issue #59 adds the emergency power
## room behind the corridor's last right-hand door: its doorway opens
## on act (no rod gate — it is a crew door, not a pry-bar hatch), and
## its working console walks the secondary power's state machine — one
## press activates the generator, and the hallway plus the power room
## hand their red emergency light over to dim regular white while the
## stasis bay keeps its red.

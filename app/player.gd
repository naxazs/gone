class_name Player
extends Node3D
## The first-person player rig, ported from gone_app player/mod.rs and
## motion.rs wiring: this node carries the yaw, a Camera3D child at eye
## height carries the pitch, and the sim owns every motion decision. The
## node integrates look from the shared input plane, projects the sim's
## capsule onto the rig (head sphere through the get-up, standing eye
## height on the floor), translates the device's InputMap actions and
## mouse onto the plane, and projects the sim's deterministic door
## opening onto the hatch's door slab every tick.

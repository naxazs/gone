## The emergency power room behind the hallway's last right-hand door
## (issue #59): the same footprint as the stasis room, pierced off the
## corridor's north wall at the power door. The room's consoles read
## futuristic-but-broken — flatscreens, blank colored-button keyboards,
## nothing mechanical — with exactly one working screen; the room's
## center holds the secondary generator, a sleek black column that
## looks inexplicably new next to the damaged walls (the stasis pods
## share that too-new quality; the reason is a later reveal). Under the
## emergency circuit the room reads red like the hall; actioning the
## working console once (the Activado label) lights the generator and
## hands the hallway and this room over to dim regular white while the
## stasis bay keeps its red. Colliders extend the hallway's set from
## solids authored here (Placement stays untouched): one construction
## path — the scene spawns these placements verbatim and the collider
## set derives from the same data.

## The room's envelope mirrors the stasis room's exactly: the corridor
## supplies the south wall band (pierced at the power door), this room
## supplies the rest of the shell — the same wall thickness, ceiling,
## and tucked floor slabs as the hallway's construction language.
